Hydropower Dispatch Model Builder

Description
-----------
This module defines the construction logic for assembling a **hydropower-only**
optimization model in Pyomo. It integrates the full sequence of:

- Set and parameter initialization,
- Decision variable declaration,
- Piecewise or analytical hydropower production modeling (FPH),
- Operational constraints,
- Objective function (optional).

Supported generation modes (per unit)
-------------------------------------
- Constant productivity
- Specific productivity with fixed head
- Exact head-dependent generation with nonlinear losses
- Simplified constant productivity (didactic)

Functions
---------
build_FPHs(m, data)
    Initialize the hydropower production function (FPH) callable for each unit.

build_hydro_dispatch(data, include_objective=True)
    Assemble a complete Pyomo model for hydropower dispatch optimization.

Modeling Conventions and Units
------------------------------
- Time periods are indexed as integers t = 1, …, horizon.
- Turbined and spill discharges (Q, S): m^3/s.
- Storage volume (V): hm^3.
- Power (G) and demand (d): MW.
- Typical power conversion constant: zeta = 9.81/1000 (when used within FPH).
- Volume conversion per period: zeta_vol = 3600/1e6 for hourly steps.

Notes
-----
- This builder targets **pure hydropower** systems. To include thermal units,
  couple with a combined system balance elsewhere.
- The callable stored in m.hydro_FPH[h] must accept the signature
  FPH(Q, V, S) → MW and be consistent with model units.
- Exact and specific modes rely on coefficient vectors that parameterize
  head or loss polynomials supplied via data.units[h].

    ----------

        Pyomo model into which the FPH callables will be attached.
    data : HydraulicData
        Configuration object containing unit maos and modes

    Assemble a complete Pyomo model for hydropower dispatch.

    The resulting model includes:

    - Set and parameter definitions (via hydraulyc_add_sets_and_params)
    - Continuous decision variables (via hydralic_add_variables_g)
    - Per-unit FPH callables (via build_FPHs)
    - Operational constraints: generation equation, reservoir mass balance,
      Qmin/Qmax, volume bounds, terminal storage target
    - Optional system-wide demand balance and cost-minimization objective

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : HydraulicData
        Input data with horizon, demand, unit map, and conversion constants.
    include_objective : bool, optional
        If True, add the hydropower balance constraint and define the
        objective function. Default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    pyomo.core.base.PyomoModel.ConcreteModel
        A Pyomo ConcreteModel ready to be passed to a solver.

    Notes
    -----
    - Designed for hydropower-only settings. For mixed hydro-thermal
      systems, use an extended builder with a combined balance equation.
    - The order of operations ensures FPH callables are available before
      generation constraints are added.

    Assemble a hydropower dispatch problem in Pyomo.

    This builder configures a Pyomo model for reservoir-based hydropower
    optimization. It attaches sets, parameters, decision variables, the
    hydropower production functions (FPHs), and all relevant operational
    constraints. Optionally, it includes the demand balance and the
    cost-minimization objective.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : pyomo.environ.ConcreteModel
        Pyomo model to which the hydropower problem will be added.
    data : HydraulicData
        Input data object containing planning horizon, demand mapping,
        unit definitions, inflows, storage bounds, and productivity
        coefficients.
    include_objective : bool, optional
        If True, add the system-wide demand balance and deficit-penalizing
        objective function (default is False).

    Returns
    -------
    pyomo.environ.ConcreteModel
        The updated Pyomo model with hydropower sets, parameters, variables,
        constraints, and optionally the objective.

    Notes
    -----
    - Constraints added:
        * Hydropower generation equation (FPH-based)
        * Minimum/maximum turbined flow
        * Reservoir volume balance (continuity)
        * Minimum/maximum storage limits
        * Terminal storage requirement
    - If include_objective=True, the system-wide balance constraint and
      the hydropower objective (deficit + spill penalty) are attached.
    - This builder targets **pure hydropower** systems; for mixed
      hydrothermal systems, a combined balance and objective should be
      used instead.
