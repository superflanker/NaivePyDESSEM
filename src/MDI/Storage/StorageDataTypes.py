Summary
-------
This module defines the fundamental **data structures** that describe
the technical, economic, and operational attributes of **energy storage units**.
It serves as the foundation for building symbolic Pyomo models used in
optimization formulations for system operation and expansion.

Description
-----------
Two main dataclasses are defined:

1. **`StorageUnit`**  
   Represents a single energy storage unit, including its operational
   parameters, efficiency characteristics, and economic coefficients.

2. **`StorageData`**  
   Aggregates all input data required to formulate a storage optimization
   problem, including horizon definition, demand, level duration,
   and a collection of `StorageUnit` instances.

Both classes provide a lightweight, strongly typed data interface for
Python–Pyomo integration, facilitating modular problem definition
and reproducible experiment design.

Mathematical Interpretation
---------------------------
Each storage unit *s* is characterized by:

- \( E_{min}, E_{max}, E_{ini} \): Minimum, maximum, and initial energy levels.  
- \( P^{ch}_{max}, P^{dis}_{max} \): Maximum charging and discharging powers.  
- \( \eta_c, \eta_d \): Charging and discharging efficiencies.  
- \( c_{op}, c_{inv} \): Operating and investment costs.  
- \( state \): Binary indicator of existing capacity (0 or 1).

The `StorageData` structure encapsulates:

- Temporal horizon \( T \)
- Demand curves by patamar and time
- Duration of load levels (in hours)
- Dictionary of `StorageUnit` definitions.

Usage
-----
Instances of `StorageData` are typically created from preprocessed
input datasets and passed directly to model-construction functions such as:

>>> from .StorageBuilder import build_storage
>>> model = build_storage(data=storage_data)

Classes
-------
StorageUnit
    Defines the parameters of a single storage unit.
StorageData
    Encapsulates all data required for the formulation of the storage problem.

Notes
-----
- This data structure is **independent of Pyomo** and can be serialized
  or deserialized to JSON for reproducibility.
- Units follow the SI convention: MWh for energy, MW for power, and
  monetary units for costs.
