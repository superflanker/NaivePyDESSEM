Thermal Model Expression Utilities for Pyomo Optimization

Description
-----------
This module provides helper functions to construct symbolic expressions
related to thermal power generation in Pyomo models. These expressions
can be incrementally assembled and used in constraints (e.g., power balance)
or in the objective function (e.g., cost minimization).

Functions are designed to be modular and composable, allowing the user to
build lists of partial expressions from multiple sources (e.g., thermal,
hydro, renewable, storage) and sum them later into complete constraints
or cost functions.

All functions operate safely: they first verify the presence of required
model components (e.g., sets, variables, parameters) before contributing
expressions. If components are missing, the expressions are skipped
silently, enabling flexible model composition.

Intended Use
------------
- To support modular construction of the objective function, especially
  when not all energy sources are known in advance.
- To build power balance equations at each time step by aggregating
  contributions from thermal and other sources.

Examples
--------
>>> cost_terms = []
>>> add_thermal_cost_expression(model, cost_terms)
>>> model.TotalCost = Objective(expr=sum(cost_terms), sense=minimize)

>>> balance_terms = []
>>> add_thermal_balance_expression(model, t=5, balance_terms)
>>> model.BalanceConstraint[5] = Constraint(expr=sum(balance_terms) == model.Demand[5])

Notes
-----
- All expressions returned are Pyomo symbolic expressions.
- This module assumes the model follows the naming convention:
  'thermal_p', 'thermal_u', 'thermal_y', 'thermal_SC', etc.

    Append the thermal generation expression at a given time step t

    This is intended for use in constructing hybrid or modular power
    balance constraints where multiple sources (thermal, hydro, solar, etc.)
    contribute to the total injected power at each time step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : ConcreteModel
        Pyomo model containing the thermal variables.
    t : int
        Time index for which the expression should be generated.
    balance_array : list of expressions
        List of symbolic expressions to which the thermal component is appended.

    Returns

    list of expressions
        The updated list including the thermal power contribution at time t.
